 I live in a 1-bedroom apartment by myself.
 I've lived here for about a year and I have to say I really like where I live although it is a small place.
 So let me tell you about what my apartment looks like!

# 본론 - 집묘사 (방과 가구)
 I've got one samll bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a utillity room.
 I don't have a lot of furniture in my place because I perfor to live with only the things I need.
 I just have a couch and a coffee table in the living room and I put them together by the window.
 And also, in the kitchen area, there are some appliacess like a fridge, a microwave and a stove.
 
# 본론 - 좋아하는 방 (현재 작은 원룸)
 I would say the room I like most is my bedroom which is located in the rear of this apartment.
 Honestly, my bedroom is not very big, but it's always been my safe haven.
 It's got a very nice, comfortable bed, a built-in closet and a thick, beige rug on the floor.

 In addition, What makes my bedroom special is that the window looks out over the trees behind my apartment building.
 Whenever I open the window, I can get some fresh air, which helps clear my head.

# 서론
 When I was young, I lived in a spacious apartment with my familly.
 It was the place where I grew up and spend my childhood.
 But I moved out of my parent's apartment when I turned 25.
 So let me compare the home i lived in before to my current gome.
 
# 본론 (과거 아파트)
 Until I was 20 in the past, I lived in a large, 4-bedroom apartment with my parents.
 It had 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a huge living room with a lot of furniture and appliances.
 Also, every room  had wood floors and big windows that made the room super bright.
 One more thing! There was a dining area connected to the kitchen.

# 본론 (현재 원룸)
 In contrast, my current home is a small studio apartment.
 It's a typical studio, so everything is in one open space.
 Basically, my whole apartment is one large room, which combines the bedroom and the kitchen into a single room.
 So, I don't have a lot of furniture like my parents do because there isn't much space in my studio.

 But one the plus side, my studio has a huge window which looks out over the trees behind my apartment building.
 I guess I love the view from my current apartment a lot more than the view I used to hav in my parent's home.
 
# 결론
 Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with where I live now.
 I have to say I'm greatful to havfe my own place, which for me is a safe haven.
