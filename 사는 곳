# 서론 - 현재 집과 위치 (언제 이사했어)
 I live in a 1-bedroom apartment by myself.
 I've lived here for about a year and I have to say I really like where I live although it is a small place.
 So let me tell you about what my apartment looks like!

# 본론 - 집묘사 (방과 가구)
 I've got one samll bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a utillity room.
 I don't have a lot of furniture in my place because I perfor to live with only the things I need.
 I just have a couch and a coffee table in the living room and I put them together by the window.
 And also, in the kitchen area, there are some appliacess like a fridge, a microwave and a stove.
 
# 본론 - 좋아하는 방 (현재 작은 원룸)
 I would say the room I like most is my bedroom which is located in the rear of this apartment.
 Honestly, my bedroom is not very big, but it's always been my safe haven.
 It's got a very nice, comfortable bed, a built-in closet and a thick, beige rug on the floor.

 In addition, What makes my bedroom special is that the window looks out over the trees behind my apartment building.
 Whenever I open the window, I can get some fresh air, which helps clear my head.

 Overall, my home is always the best place for me to chill.
 It is very cozy and comfortable place, which has made me a homebody!
