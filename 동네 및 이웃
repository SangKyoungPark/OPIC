Q. I would like to know about your neighborhood.
   What does your neighborhood look like? Please discribe your neighborhood  in as much detail as possible.

# 서론 (동네이름)
 It's a good question because I really like where I live now.
 I live in Ansan, which is small city.
 I moved to a studio apartment in Ansan about 5 years ago,
 and I've been very happy with my current neighborhood.

# 본론 (동네 위치와 생김새 )
 So, my neighborhood is located in the west part of Seoul.
 The name of my town is Ansan.
 It's a mostly residential(주거) neighborhood with many restaurants,
 coffee shops and gorcery stores.
 In addition, there are some side roads with apartment buildings and small shops.
 Oh! there's a subway station at the intersection, which makes it really convenient to get around.

# 본론 (동네의 특별한 점)
 What I like the most about my neighborhood is that
 there's a really nice park.
 I mean, it's located in a major city, but there's a nice forest park with lots of trees!
 So, I like that the window in my aprartment looks out over the trees behind the apartment building.
 The view is just awesome!

# 결론 (동네 최고)
 Honestly, at times, I feel like I wanna move to a new place
 because living in the same neighborhood cna be a little boring.
 But overall, I can say I'm definitely satisfied with my neighborhood.

  He has short black hair, wears cap and  likes to wear jeans and T-shirts.
  He often hears from people that he has an eye for fashion!

  what I really like about Ji-In is that he opens up to peope easily and is very outgoing.
  I always find his easygoing manner quite charming.
  You know what? I first met him at the park near my apartment building.
  Although he was with other nighbors, he saw that I was alone and immediately struck up a conversation with me.
  We've been really close ever since.
 
 # 결론
 So now, we like to hang out on weekends and play sports together sometimes.
 Usually this means kicking a soccer ball around or going th the movies!
 So, I would say I'm really lucky to have such a good neighbor like Ji-In.
