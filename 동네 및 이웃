# 서론 (집과 동네)
 It's a good question because I really like where I live now.
 I live in Ansan, which is the small city of South Korea.
 I moved to a studio apartment in Ansan about 5 years ago, and I've been very happy with my current neighborhood.

# 본론 (동네 위치와 생김새) 
 So, my neighborhood is located in the west part of Seoul.
 The name of my town is Ansan.
 It's a mostly residential neighborhood(상업지구) with many restaurants coffee shops and grocery stores.
 In addition, there are some side roads with apartment builings and samll shops.
 Oh! there's a subway station at the intersection(교차로), which makes it really convenient to get around(돌아다니기).

# 본론 (동네의 특별한 점 = 장점)
 What I like the most about my neighborhood is that there's really nice park.
 I mean, it is locatied in a SooWon, but there's a nice forest park with lots of trees!
 So, I like that the window in my apartment looks out over the trees behind the apartment building.
 The view is just awesome!

# 결론 (내 동네 최고!)
 Honestly, at time, I feel like I want to move to a new place because living in the same neighborhood cna be a little boring.
 But overall, I can say I'm pretty satisfied with my neighborhood

# 본론 (무슨 일 묘사)
   So when I was about 5, I lived in a small neighborhood near a large lake park.
   One day, I went to the park by myself.
   I guess I just got so curious, So I went by myself anyway.
   And on my way to the home, I got lost.[러스트]
   At first, I tried to backtrack the way I came, but it was no use.
   You know what? I got so scared and started to cry.

# 본론 (어떤 결과 묘사)
   Can you imagine? So when I didn't return, my parents got worried and went out to track me down.
   Fortunately, before it got really dark, I heard my brother and other neighbors yelling my name!
   They were like, "SangKyoung ~~ Where are you~~"
   Of course I just ran to my brother as fast as I could.
   I was so relieved at that moment.

# 결론
   I know it's a long time ago, but these days, I'm often reminded of the incident when I visit the park in my hometown.
   It was such a frightening experience at the time, but it's amusing when I look back on it now.
