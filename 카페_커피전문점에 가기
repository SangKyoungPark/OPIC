# 서론 : 좋은 카페 많아
  I really like going to coffee shops, so I've been to a lot of coffee shops in my country.
  Since I live in a small city, Ansan, there are some nice coffee shops nearby.
  Well, I can say coffee shops are literally[리럴리] everywhere in Ansan.

# 본론 : 카페 이름, 위치, 생김새
  Speaking of my favorite coffee shop I've been going to my favorite cafe almost every day for a years now.
  It's called 'The Queen' which is only stone's throw from my apartment.
  I would say it's about a 5-minute walk from my home.
  This place is kinda small.
  Maybe large enough to hold 5 to 6 tables.
  But there's open terrace where you can enjoy the sun while drinking coffee.
  
# 본론 : 카페의 특별한 점 ( 커피와 주인의 친절함)
  What makes 'The Queen' so special is their excellent coffee.
  I really like the coffee there, especially their Americano!
  Actually, they've got really good cookies, too, but I normally just get coffee.
  Oh, one more thing! I should also mention the owner.
  She's super friendly and welcoming every time I visit!
  I mean, even if I sit there for hours, she always smiles and accommodates any requests I have.

# 결론 :
  All in all, I feel very lucky to have such a nice coffee shop close to my home.
  I would say 'The Queen' is a perfect place to chill and enjoy a cup of coffee.
  Although it gets a little crowded packed on weekends,
  I love its upbeat and relaxing atmosphere!

  Sometimes, I bring my laptop and study for tests until late at night.
  My typical routine involves ordering a ice Americano.
  Some coffee places have a great selection of cakes and sandwiches, so I grab bite sometimes.

  My special experience at a coffee shop? Well.. Let's see...
  Oh! I remember a time when I bumped into[범ㅍ틴투] my friend at a famous coffee shop.
  It was a few months ago when I was out of town on my vacation.
  Actually, it happened on a trip with my family.
  
# 본론 : 어디서, 무슨 일
  On the first day of trip in 배곧 park, we went to this nice coffee place by the beach.
  The place was super busy, so we had to wait in line to order.
  In the mean time, I was chatting with my family.
  but then, I noticed the woman standing in front of me looked familiar.
  After a minute, I realized it was my neighbor friend, Je-in.
  So I tapped her on the shoulder and said hi!
  When he turned around, he recognized me right away!

# 본론 : 특별했던 점!
  What made the incident so special was that we hadn't seen each other since graduation.
  I mean, I hadn't seen her for such a long time, so i was really happy to see her.
  I guess you could call it a very special chance meeting I had.
  So we exchanged our phone numbers and promised to meet again.

# 결론 : 기억에 남는 날!
  Overall, it was really nice to run into a friend like that, and I would say it was a very pleasant experience.
  This incident was so memorable because it allowed me to rekindle an old friendshop.
  You know what? We've spoken on the phone many times since then!
