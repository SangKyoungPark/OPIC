Q. I'd like to the interview. Can you say something about yourself ?

 Hi, I’m SangKyoung.
 Actually, I don’t really know what to tell you about myself. 
 (But.. Uh) 
 
 These days, I’m currently looking for a job. 
 My goal is to get into my dream company.
 In order to do that, I hope I can improve my job qualification in the near future.
 
 So, I'm preparing for OPIC.
 Last time I got an IM1, but this time I tried to get an AL.
 I prepared a lot this time.
 I'll take the AL !
 
 (you know what...)
 What I usually do in my free time is exercising and listening to music.
 I usually listen to R&B music, and when I exercise, I listen to club music.
 
 This is the end of my introduction, thank you for listening.
