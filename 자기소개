# 본론 - 취미
 Oh! Let me tell you about what I do for fun.
 When I want to have some fun, I go camping to the beaches or mountaings, and I love traveling.
 But there are times when I just wanna kick back, relax and just chill at home.
 So my hobbies these days include listening to music and watching Netflix.
 Watching a movie while eating good good is a great way to relieve stress.
