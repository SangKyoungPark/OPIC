Q. Let’s start the interview now. Tell me a little bit about yourself.

 Hi, I’m SangKyoung.
 Actually, I don’t really know what to tell you about myself. 
 (But.. Uh) These days, I’m currently looking for a job. 
 My goal is to get into my dream company, In order to do that, I hope I can improve my job qualification in the near future.
 So, I'm preparing for OPIC.
 Last time I got an IM1, but this time I tried to get an AL.
 I prepared a lot this time.
 I'll take the AL!
 Even if I don’t receive AL, I’ll continue to challenge!
 This is myself introduction, thank you for listening.
