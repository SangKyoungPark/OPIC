@ 가장 좋아하는 방 = 내가 사는 집
Q. Please tell me about your house. What's your favorite room? 
   What does it look like? Why do you like that room?

# 서론 (좋아하는 방 = 내가 사는 집)
   I live in a studio by myself.
   I've lived here since i was 20, and I have to say I really like where I live although it is a small place.
   So let me tell you about what my apartments looks like !
   
# 본론 (집 묘사 (방과 가구))
   I've got one small bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a utility room.
   I don't have a lot of furniture in my place because I live alone.
   I just have a couch and a coffee table in the living room,
   and I put them together by the window.
   And also, in the kitchen area, there are some appliances like a fridge, a microwave and a stove.
   
# 본론(내 방이 좋은 이유)
   I would say the room I like most is my bedroom which is located in the rear of the apartment.
   Honestly, my bedroom is not very big, but it's always been my safe haven.
   It's got a very nice, comfortable bed, a built-in closet and a thick, black rug on the floor.

+) In addition, what makes my bedroom special is that the window looks out over the tree behind my apartment building.
   Whenever I open the window, I can get some fresh air, wich helps clear my head.

# 결론 (내집이 최고)
   Overall, my home is always the best place for me to chill.
   It is a very cozy and comfortable place, which has made me a homebody!
   I just love staying home!

@ 과거와 현재의 집 비교
Q. Compare the home you lived in before to the one you live in now.
   What are the differences between those two homes?
   Provide me with as many detail as posible.
   
# 서론 (언제 이사했어)
   When I was young, I lived in a spacious with my family.
   It was the place where I grew up are spent my childhood.
   But I moved out of my parents' apartment about 2 years ago.
   So let me compare the home I lived in before to my current home.

# 본론 (과거 = 큰 아파트)
   Until I was 20 in the past, I lived in a large, 3-bedroom apartment with my parents.
   It had 3 bedrooms, 2 bathroooms and a large living room with a lot of furniture and appliances.
   Also, every room had wood floors and big windows that made the room super bright.
   One more thing! There was a dining area connected to the kitchen.

# 본론 (현재 = 작은 원룸)
   In contrast, my current home is a samll studio apartment.
   It's a typical studio, so everything is in one open space.
   Basically, my whole apartment is one large room, which combines the bedroom and the kitchen into a single room.
   So, I don't have a a lot of furniture like my parents do because there isn't much space in my studio.
   
+) But on the plus side, my studio has a huge window whitch looks out over the park behind my apartment building.
   I guess I love the view from my current apartment a lot more than the view I used to have in my parents' home.

# 결론
   Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with where I live now.
   I have to say I'm grateful to have my own palce, which for me is a safe haven.
   
   
@ 집에서 겪은 문제 (= 집에서 겪은 경험)
Q. Have you ever had any problems with your home? What was the problem,
   and how did you deal with it? How did the problem turn out?
   Give me as many details as possible.

# 서론 (문제의 경험 소개)
   To be honest, I haven't had many problems with my home because I don't spend much time at home.
   Well, now that I think about it, I remember a time when the bathroom flooded with water.

# 본론 (문제 상황 묘사) * 과거시제로 잘 말할 것!
   So one day, I woke up on a Sunday morning, and found the bathroom flooded with wather.
   A big problem I had that morning was a leaking toilet.
   I searched for the root of the problem and noticed there was water leaking from my toilet.
   
# 본론 (해결상황 묘사)
   So, I called a plumber right away and requested an appointment, but he wasn't able to come immediately.
   When the plumber arrived like an hour later, he was able to fix the leak within minutes.
   The problem was solved, but I still had to deal with the flooded apartment.
   I remember it took all morning to clean everthing up.

# 결론 (그래서 가장 기억에 남아)
   So, overall, it was such a crazy experience I had with my home.
   You can't imagine how exhausted I was by the time I was done cleaning my apartment.
   I feel like I should learn how to fix the toilet my self beacuse I want to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again!
